<p>Yes, I know, probably not that a big thing to have it’s seperate post, but it’ll sent to FB, Twitter &amp; G+ automatically, and as I’m too lazy to do that, posting this’ll do it for me.</p>
<p>I accidentally wrote the wrong dates in the <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #24890d;" title="When shall we play? VOTE!" href="http://www.howtovacuumgames.6f.sk/tunnelers/when-shall-we-play-vote/">previous post</a>. It’s fixed, so please correct your votes accordingly. Just for the info, it’s the week <strong style="font-weight: bold; font-style: inherit;">23.07.2014-29.07.2014</strong>, so a week from now.</p>
<p>Also, a bit more info on the matches (since I’m writing this anyway), there will be one+ matches (according how many players will be), one will be Teamspeaked &amp; streamed/recorded, and the others will be just for random people who don't know much about the game or don't have much experience with it and don't want to be on a sort of "comeback" match.</p>
<p>So that's that, be sure to invite everyone you know.</p>
