<p>Oh, not for you, for me. Duh.</p>
<p>You get another boring version, I get to work on the awesome stuff.</p>
<p>So yeah, this is what's coming up for Gamma:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bots - that's right, if you don't have friends you will able to play alone</li>
<li>New GUI - have you heard of Unity's <a href="http://isthenewguioutyet.com/" target="_blank">new GUI</a>? Well, it's getting into Gamma with all it's beauty</li>
<li>Mobile - Android, and hopefully iOS. Maybe Ubuntu Phone</li>
<li>Physics based shaders - they came with Unity 5, and look wonderful. I didn't have time to get them into Beta, but I surely will for Gamma</li>
<li>Allow playing while hosting the server - to play on your own server right now you have to open a new instance, which isn't exactly fun. Hopefully I'll be able to get this working for Gamma</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds interesting? It is. I am so glad I got Beta 1 out so I can work on this. It's just so cool.</p>
<p>I already started laying out foundations for the new AI on a local branch, but I doubt I'll be able to get to it again until the school year ends, which should be in about two weeks.</p>
<p>Also, if you've got ANY sort of screenshots of Tunnelers somewhere, anywhere, chuck them here. It'll be great help while making the GUI. Thanks.</p>
<p>And again, if you're not already subscribed to the mailing list, please do. You would not believe how hard it is to reach all you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I told you I wouldn't leave Tunnelers alone.</p>
