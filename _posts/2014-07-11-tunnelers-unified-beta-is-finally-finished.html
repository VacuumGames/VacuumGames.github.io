<p>I mean it. Done and ready, built and uploaded.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is time for me to announce that you can play Tunnelers online again.</p>
<p>It's not as good as the original, but hey, I made it myself.</p>
<p><strong>I am so sorry for the gigantic delay. It has been a very hard year for me and I had very little to none time to code.</strong></p>
<p>But the important thing is that it is finished.</p>
<p>AND NOW THE IMPORTANT THING I AM WRITING THIS FOR:</p>
<h1><span style="color: #000000;">WHEN SHALL WE PLAY?!</span></h1>
<p>Write in the comments! <strong>Will</strong> you play and <strong>when</strong> will you play.</p>
<p>Now that Tunnelers: Unified is multiplayer, we need a party of people to play with. Idealy 8v8 or more. So if you can, come!</p>
<p>What you can look forward to in Beta:</p>
<ul>
<li>multi-player</li>
<li>capture the flag</li>
<li>lasers</li>
<li>explosions</li>
<li>two new maps</li>
<li>a brand new UI (with a Quit button!)</li>
<li>and of course,Â the rejoicing of old comrades</li>
</ul>
<p>All the features should be fully functional*.</p>
<p><strong>So what are you waiting for?! Comment!</strong></p>
