<p>Yep. I worked on the site yesterday a bit, and it's now better than ever.</p>
<p>The biggest changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>should load faster</li>
<li>the site should now be found by search engines</li>
<li>a new <a title="What the FAQ?!" href="http://www.howtovacuumgames.6f.sk/what-the-faq/">FAQ</a> section</li>
<li><a title="HERE IT SI" href="http://www.howtovacuumgames.6f.sk/?attachment_id=187" target="_blank">THE AWESOME TUNNELERS WALLPAPER!</a></li>
<li>a new way of auto-posting to social networks</li>
<li>a subscribe by email button</li>
<li>a new contact form</li>
<li>better sidebars</li>
<li>a slightly new comment system</li>
<li>WordPress.com sign in</li>
<li>and some other thing</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning: this site is still not perfect, and there are many things that could be better.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Tunnelers is just around the corner! (I know I say that every time)</p>
<p>Shortly after this I'll make a post with some snapshots from the first map. See ya on the battlefield.</p>
